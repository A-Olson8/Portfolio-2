# Portfolio-2/Airline Delay Analysis

&nbsp;

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;To Improve efficiency, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) wants to know how often flights are delayed, and for what reasons.
The dataset shows all flight delays in September 2023, and will give a good indication on why delays occur.  Furthermore, the data will reveal which airlines and airports experience the most delays.

&nbsp;

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;Notice below that weather delays make up only 5.11% of delays.  While late aircraft delays make up 14.87% of delay occurances, they account for over a third of total delay minutes.  Carrier delays (delays caused by the airline) account for another large shair of delays.

&nbsp;

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;The FAA also wishes to know what are the most congested airports in the country (in terms of overall delays, late arrivals, and taxi in/out times).  The six charts below will allow them to see which which airports are consistantly congested across multiple categories.

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;Lastly, for delays caused by airlines, the FAA would like to identify which airliners had the most carrier delays in the country.  They also want to know which airlines had highest percentage of their flights delayed (for carrier reasons).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;To conclude, after analysing the charts, the FAA was able to ascertane that in September 2023, the most congested airpots across the board where New York (JFK), Chicago(Ord), Dallas/Fort Worth(DFW), Los Angeles(LAX), Las Vegas(LAS), and Boston(Bos).  These airports may be over congested due antiquated infastructure and a shortage of terminal and runway space.  As for airlines, the airliners with the highest number of carrier delays where Southwest, Delta, American, and United Airlines.  However, since these are larger airlines, the percentage of their flights that had a carrier delay was relatively low.  Large airlines that had a high percentage of their flights experience a carrier delay where JetBlue, Frontier, and Spirit Airlines.  These airlines may have maintenance and personel issues that contribute to these delays The FAA will use this data for further consideration on how/where they can decrease delays.
